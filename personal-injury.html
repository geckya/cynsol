<h4>Cynthia has handled over 1000 insurance claims and knows how to help you navigate the system.</h4>
</blockquote>
When you are injured by a negligent party, speed is of the essence. Contact us immediately after injury and we will meet with you. After having handled over 1000 insurance claims, Cynthia knows that assistance at the beginning of your case can drastically change your outcome.
<br><br>
<blockquote>
<h4>The initial meeting is always free. No catch. Just helpful advice from an experienced attorney.</h4>
</blockquote>
Before speaking to an insurance company, give us a call. We can't promise we will take your case since we purposefully keep our caseload small and manageable, but we can promise to help in some way. Not everyone needs an attorney. Some people just need help navigating the system, and I am always willing to offer some assistance for free at an initial meeting.

If you have been injured through the negligence of someone else, we would love to meet you. Even if we are ultimately not the firm for you, we meet with everyone and offer our initial consultation for free. Sometimes, all you need to know is how to navigate a basic claim yourself, and we are happy to help you with that, for free.
