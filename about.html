At Soliz Law, we believe in the power of individualized attention. This firm was started by Cynthia Soliz to offer an alternative to the personal injury firms in Austin. By taking fewer cases, we are able to actively engage with our clients, get to know their stories, be able to explain their challenges better, and maximize their recovery. All our current clients have their attorney's personal cell phone number and can call them with questions.

<h4>Sometimes, all you need to know is how to navigate a basic claim yourself.</h4>

We also believe in being involved in our community. Cynthia is a leader in her community and many local groups. Highly involved with her son's PTA, she is active in her neighborhood and local mom's groups as well. She also has donated over a hundred pro bono hours to the local non-profit group, Babywearing International of Greater Austin, which aims to teach safety in babywearing. She regularly contributes to their blog and is an active volunteer regular at meetings and in their discussion group. She also speaks at discounted rates to local business groups on risk management and liability awareness.
