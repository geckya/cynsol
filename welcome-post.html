Welcome! I started this firm with the idea that taking fewer cases would allow for better telling of the client's story. At my core, I am and have always been a story-teller. It's that ability to tell a client's story to an insurance adjuster, to opposing counsel, to a jury, that adds value to your personal injury claim. 

Lately, I've also found a passion in helping business owners mitigate their risk -- avoid liabilities in the first place! An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

I also currently blog at www.bwiaustin.org/blog for one of my favorite local nonprofits.
